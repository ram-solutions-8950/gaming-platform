"""In-memory registry of live Deals Rummy games, keyed by table id.

For a single-process deployment this is sufficient. For horizontal scaling, the
authoritative game state should move behind Redis (one owner process per table) and this
manager becomes the local cache for the table's owning worker. The engine itself is
already serialisable via `public_state()` + per-player hands.
