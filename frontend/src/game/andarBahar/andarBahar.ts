/**
 * Andar Bahar game engine (pure functions, no UI/network).
 *
 * Rules:
 *  - One 52-card deck is shuffled. The top card is the "joker" (middle card).
 *  - The starting side is decided by the middle card's colour: a black middle card
 *    (♠/♣) starts on ANDAR, a red one (♥/♦) starts on BAHAR. (Common Indian rule.)
 *  - Cards are dealt one at a time, alternating sides starting from the start side,
 *    until a card of the SAME RANK as the middle card appears. That side wins.
 *  - Players bet ANDAR or BAHAR before the deal.
